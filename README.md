Assignment was to design and train a classifier and a generative model using the CIFAR-100 dataset and to write a  scientific report detailing both methods, experimental results, and limitations. Specific requirements: discriminitive  model must have fewer than 100,000 (one hundred thousand) parameters and generative must have fewer than 1,000,000 (one million) parameters.

This paper proposes use of deep dense convolutional network (DenseNet) to classify images, and using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate images on CIFAR-100 dataset of resolu- tion 32x32. The paper discusses utilised methodologies and presents, and analyses yielded results.

Mark: 91/100
Feedback: Overall, this is a perfect submission. The report and solution is perfect, with a perfect performing classifier
and excellent realism and excellent diversity for your generative model.
Both the classifier and generative models are well-designed and well-tuned approaches, and this is an excellent example of getting the basics right. Although the resulat of the generative model are rather washed
out, the FID score is high. I would have liked to see a slightly more in-depth ablation study and results of a
thorough hyperparameter optimisation process to squeeze a little bit more performance out of these models.
Well done overall.
